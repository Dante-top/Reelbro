    desc: `Every time you buy $REELBRO, you’re doing more than investing — you’re joining a cycle of giving that transforms lives.
Our unique 30-day charitable fund lets real people from anywhere in the world submit causes that matter to them. Think grassroots campaigns, JustGiving-style projects, and everyday heroes trying to make a difference — not just registered charities.
From cricket equipment for rural villages in Pakistan, to basketball courts in underserved US neighbourhoods, to indoor 3G football pitches for struggling communities in the UK — every vote supports something meaningful.`,

    title: "How it works:",
    desc: `Supporters submit their causes by contributing a small amount in SOL.
This entry fuels buy pressure and keeps the system alive with fresh momentum.
You vote. One cause receives the full REELBRO fund each month. The rest stay in the running for future rounds.
This creates a continuous cycle of participation, visibility, and impact-driven entirely by the community.`,

  {
    title: "Tokenomics That Actually Give Back",
    desc: `$REELBRO is designed for sustainability, growth, and rewards — with a tokenomics model that supports both holders and the causes they care about:
  •  SOL entry fees from listed causes create demand
  •  A percentage of all revenue is burned to reduce supply
  •  Long-term stakers are rewarded with high APY in a secure, audited contract
  •  Community voting encourages engagement
  •  Listings drive ongoing buy pressure and token utility
This is a real ecosystem. No empty hype — just a token that works hard while doing good.`,
